he was examined. No x-rays were taken. A whiplash-type injury was diagnosed and he was 
discharged with advice.  
The pain in his neck and back was severe for four weeks, interfering with 
sleep and needing analgesics which then improved. He has had no physiotherapy.

There have been no psychological symptoms as a consequence of the 
accident.

He is unemployed. The accident affected his ability to go to the gym for one 
month. 
 
EXAMINATION: 
He is a man of normal build with a normal gait. 
Examination of his upper limbs is normal.  
Examination of his cervical spine shows a full range of movement actively 
and passively in all directions. There was no muscular tenderness. 
Flexion/extension of his lumbosacral spine is full. Straight leg rising is full. 
There was no spinal tenderness. There were no other marks, scars, or bruises and no 
inappropriate responses.  
 
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS: 
As a result of a road traffic accident on the 10th February 2010, Chris Smith 
sustained a whiplash injury to his cervical spine and a lower back sprain.  
The injuries sustained are compatible with the accident. The adverse feature 
associated with the accident was a double impact.  
As a consequence of the accident he had severe pain in his neck and back for 
three weeks before improvement. His back pain is now resolved and had done by the last 
week of March. He still has occasional neck pain on turning. 
Psychologically, there has been no consequence to the accident. The accident 
had affected his ability to go to the gym for one month. He was unemployed at the time of 
the accident.  
Examination shows that movement of his cervical spine and lumbosacral 
spine is full and pain-free actively and passively in all directions.

PROGNOSIS: 
In my opinion and on the balance of probability, a full physical recovery can 
be anticipated from the effects of the accident at a time within six months of the date of the 
accident. I base my opinion on the facts that recovery to-date has been satisfactory and the 
range of movement of his cervical spine and lumbosacral spine is full.  
In my opinion, there have been no long-term implications for acceleration of 
the degeneration of his cervical or lumbosacral spine. I have no further recommendations to 
make regarding further investigations, specialist opinions or treatment. The client is a good 
historian. His injuries are consistent with the accident.  
The injury will have no long-term effect on his future work prospects. 
 
REVIEW OF MEDICAL RECORDS: 
This report has been compiled without access to his General Practitioner 
notes. 
In my opinion, examination notes are not required, as the client is a good 
reliable historian and the injuries sustained are compatible with the accident described.
